# hello-world
My name is Minodora,everybody know me as Mino.I am 26 years  old and I am currently studying Chemistry with Forensic Science at University of Leicester in UK. I am romanian on origins but settled in UK four years ago.I am shy but with timeI come as a very talkative person.I am curious and doubting everything in my life hence why I am here as every day I doubt and search for more ways to spend my time but I do not commit to much.This year I hope to achieve change in my life.
this is my first repository and i have no previous experience with Github
i will slowly start understanding this whole new field
